# A Message From Hatred Industries:

"SHOVEL by Hatred Industries is a social media website, I guess, where your voice doesn't matter. Discuss with your fellow shovelers about current world topics, or not, and even invest in the stock market if you're feeling daring. No hate speech of ANY kind allowed*.

*most of the time

Shovel is a property of Hatred Industries. We are not responsible for the content seen on the website."

# What is this?

An experience made to simulate social media websites where you can see and reply to posts, invest in the stock market and personalize your profile.

All the posts seen are randomly made from txt files created within your "%appdata%/Godot/app_userdata/shovel" which can be edited and added into the game! TL;DR: ABSOLUTELY NO AI BULLSHIT!!! The game is moddable to the extreme. so much so we even added a GitHub to help folks create their own experiences: https://github.com/waterPsychiatrist/SHOVEL-By-Hatred-Industries

This is not a real website nor connected to the internet in any way, all the language used about that factor is purely to maintain the fiction.

# Why is this a thing?

This is based on a fictional website created by our programmer "waterPsychiatrist" for a TTRPG campaign of HYPERMALL: UNLIMITED VIOLENCE  by Rat Bastard Games. Some of the people mentioned in this are friends of her's and/or the characters they play in the campaign!

# TRIGGER WARNINGS:

While it is satirical that Hatred Industries does not approve of the messages within SHOVEL, we the creators made this to poke fun at bigots themselves, not to spread hate throughout the world.

    Randomly generated racism
    Randomly generated abelism
    Randomly generated transphobia

...and other kinds of randomly generated bigotry.
# Additional things:

If you wanna submit a bug/glitch report or a suggestion for a game mechanic utilize our contact email or reply to this form.

Images in the memes of SHOVEL are NOT ours, except for the art made by our resident artist/wizard dordomo. If you could help identify where some of these images came from, we'll gladly thank you.

Once loaded onto the main page, use "Esc" to open the user / settings page and "Home" to reload the main page (the one with all the small posts.)

If the randomizer files appear blank / the game keeps printing "YOU FUCKED UP", install them manually by putting them "%appdata%/Godot/app_userdata/shovel". The folder will only appear after opening the program once.

Some features are not implemented yet, like: making your own posts, input remapping, DMs with users, up-digging and down-digging posts and the consequences in the stock market via interaction with posts.
